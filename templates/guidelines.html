<h2 id="types-of-contribution">Types of contribution</h2>

<p>OLDI accepts two main types of contribution:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Fixes to existing data:</strong> in case of incorrect or incomplete exisiting translations.</li>
    <li><strong>Completely new translations:</strong> typically involves starting from the original English data and having it translated by qualified, native speakers of the target language.</li>
</ol>

<p>In either case, please get in touch with the organisers to discuss your contribution before starting work. This ensures nobody else is already working on the same task and allows the community to better coordinate work.</p>

<h2 id="language-codes">Language codes</h2>

<p>We use standardized language codes throughout OLDI, made up of three parts separated by underscores:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>A language subtag:</strong> an <a href="https://iso639-3.sil.org/code_tables/639/data">ISO 639-3</a> language code. Macrolanguage codes must not be used if a more specific code exists: e.g. please use <code>cmn</code>, <code>yue</code>, <code>wuu</code>, etc. rather than <code>zho</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>A script subtag:</strong> an <a href="https://unicode.org/iso15924/iso15924-codes.html">ISO 15924</a> script code.</li>
    <li><p><strong>A language variety subtag:</strong> a <a href="https://glottolog.org/glottolog/glottologinformation">Glottocode</a> identifying the specific language variety. These have the advantages of being stable and of allowing granular language identification.</p>
    <p><strong>Example</strong>: <code>apc_Arab_sout3123</code> is South Levantine Arabic written in the Arabic script.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dataset-card">Dataset card</h2>

<p>For new data, we collect precise information about the language variety, the quality assurance workflow and, where applicable, the translation workflow. We provide a <a href="https://github.com/openlanguagedata/contribution-resources/blob/2ea6ecf17fe010270f482190a1d122898f46a27c/dataset-card-template.md">dataset card template</a> which should be filled out as fully as possible. </p>

<h2 id="translation-guidelines">Translation guidelines</h2>

<p>All translators who will be contributing data should acknowledge and abide by our <a href="https://github.com/openlanguagedata/contribution-resources/blob/2ea6ecf17fe010270f482190a1d122898f46a27c/translation-guidelines.md">translation guidelines</a>. These ensure consistent and high-quality translations. In particular, please note that some machine translation services (including DeepL, Google Translate, and ChatGPT) prohibit the use of their output for training other translation or AI models, so their use is not permitted. </p>

<h2 id="delivery">Delivery</h2>

<p>The OLDI datasets are hosted on <a href="https://huggingface.co/openlanguagedata">Hugging Face</a>. To deliver your contribution, submit a pull request to the appropriate repository. Make sure to include both the data and the dataset card!</p>

<p>By contributing to OLDI, you agree to the <a href="https://developercertificate.org">Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)</a>.
