## Workflow  
<!-- What workflow was followed in creating this dataset? E.g., for a translated dataset, relevant information includes: what language the content was translated from, the number of translators, aggregate translator information (how many were native speakers in the target language, how many were highly proficient in the target languages, how many had professional translation experience), was any fraction of the data checked independently by third parties, etc. -->  
Data was translated from English by 5 translators, all native speakers of the target language and highly proficient in English (at C2 level of the European Language Framework). All translators were either professional translators or had relevant qualifications (university degrees in Translation and Interpreting or Linguistics). 100% of the data was checked by one more independent translator.  

## Additional guidelines  
<!-- Were any additional guidelines agreed upon? Examples might include style guidelines, the use of particular grammatical forms or sentence structures, specific spelling or punctuation rules to be followed, etc. -->
