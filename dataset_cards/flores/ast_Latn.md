## Workflow

The Asturian sentences were originally obtained by Meta via professional translation from English using professional translators as part of their *no language left behind*. We had this translation into Asturian reviewed by native speakers, some of whom are members of the *Academia de la Llingua Asturiana*, philologists and  a renowned writer, translator, and activist for the Asturian language. The revision process was carried out twice by different people. In the first round, the reviewers were presented with the Spanish text and the existing version of the Asturian FLORES+, and in the second round, with the Spanish FLORES+ version and the first revised version.

## Additional guidelines

The guidelines provided by the Academia de la Llingua Asturiana were followed to ensure that the translation into Asturian aligned with their recommendations.
